    "text": "Write a short, fun, text-only daily post (with emojis, hashtags, and a builder vibe) for Day 1 of building an AI fitness app in public. The focus should be on setting expectations and building excitement for the developer's journey including a brief description of the app, the target audience, the motivations for building it, the expected timeline for releasing it, and any challenges expected during development. Additionally, the post should encourage engagement from the developer's community, inviting them to join the adventure and offer support as needed. The style should be informal, welcoming, and reflective of the developer's personality, ensuring the post represents a clear and honest statement as to what the audience can expect from the developer throughout the project."
